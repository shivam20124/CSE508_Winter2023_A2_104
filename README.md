Q2:
1. Created the common tf-icf matrix in: 'preprocessing_tf_icf.ipynb' file. Gives the files: 'tf_matrix.csv' and 'tf_icf_matrix.csv'
2. Creating tf-icf features file for each doc in code file: 'features.ipynb'. Gives us the file: 'all_features.csv' ( the file is present her: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hzf-rEdavU1d-AAfQPYmIERV7CtDNswN/view?usp=share_link  due to large size)
3. Implemented Naive Bayes in file: 'naive_bayes.ipynb'
4. For improving naive bayes, created a tf-idf matrix for the docs in: 'tf_idf_Q2.ipynb' file which stores the matrix in 'q2_tf_idf.csv'file.
